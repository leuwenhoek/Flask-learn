    <h1>About flask:</h1>
    <p>Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, often called a "micro-framework," designed for building
        web applications. It provides the essential tools for web development, like routing, request processing, and
        template handling, without requiring extra, unnecessary dependencies. This minimalist approach allows developers
        to focus on the core functionality of their applications and choose to add extensions for additional features as
        needed.
